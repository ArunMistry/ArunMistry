### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You have found my GitHub! I am Arun Mistry, a second year student in McMaster University, studying Mechatronics Engineering. My passion lies in robotics, from building to coding to debugging. Feel free to check out my repositories and contact me through the links on my website!

I will be creating many more projects over the Summer, so feel free to look at the code for my website until then!
